It can leverage tools and other dependecies

In short an LLM model takes some input text and outputs text 

An agent can take input texts feed it to an LLM model, MAKE MULTIPLE thoughts under the hood

Those thoughts can decide to use a tool and decidee next step make a decision and output that

AI AGENT TOOLS
      - Think of it as a fn an ai agent can call on to help complete a task it cant complete on its own
      - Tools allow ai agents to interact with other systems gather data or take actions
